    "For example, movies makers are notorious for overrepresenting some parts of society while underrepresenting others. While a movie audience is made of 50% women, only 24% of movie leads are women. 68% of all female characters were white in the top 100 films of 2017. 16% were Black, 7% were Asian, 7% were Latina, and 2% were of another race or ethnicity [[Women & Hollywood](https://womenandhollywood.com/resources/statistics/)]. \n",

    "One clear example of how this can go wrong can be demonstrated by facial recognition software. Joy was a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab, working facial detection software, but she had trouble testing her code because the out of the box face detection software never detected her face. To test her code, she had to wear a white mask to be recognized. \n",
