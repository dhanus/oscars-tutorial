    "While the internet and our newfound scraping skills can give us a ton of data, to develop good models, we need to consider that data with some skepticism and look at the errors our models make. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, movies makers are notorious for overrepresenting some parts of society while underrepresenting others. While a movie audience is made of 50% women, only 24% of movie leads are women. 68% of all female characters were white in the top 100 films of 2017. 16% were Black, 7% were Asian, 7% were Latina, and 2% were of another race or ethnicity [[Women & Hollywood](https://womenandhollywood.com/resources/statistics/)]. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if we want to use movie data from previous, we have to be aware that most of the leads and speaking characters are going to have light skin and ~76% of them will be male.\n",
    "\n",
    "One clear example of how this can go wrong can be demonstrated by facial recognition software. Joy was a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab, working facial detection software, but she had trouble testing her code because the out of the box face detection software never detected her face. To test her code, she had to wear a white mask to be recognized. \n",

    "Because the training data contained many light-skinned faces (similar to those below), the software was incapable of recognizing faces that deviated from that norm. \n",
